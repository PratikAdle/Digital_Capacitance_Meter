# Digital_Capacitance_Meter
In this project our objective is to build a simple Digital Capacitance Meter, a device for measuring capacitance, with a range of about 1 nano Farad to 100 micro Farad. When we come across circuits in attempt to repair it, we need to know the capacitance of particular capacitor in the board to eliminate the fault. We face a problem in getting the exact value of capacitor from the board. We can buy equipment for measuring the capacitance, but such device is costly. So, with that in mind we have designed a simple Digital Capacitance Meter using Arduino to measure the capacitance of unknown capacitors. Digital capacitance meter using Arduino relies on the basic property of capacitor i.e. the time constant. Larger capacitors take more time to charge, and therefore have larger time constants. An Arduino can measure capacitance because the time a capacitor takes to charge can be measured using Arduino.
